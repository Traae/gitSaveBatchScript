# gitSaveBatchScript

A git "quick save" windows batch script.

- Sometimes you need to save you're work to a remote repository.
  - Sometimes you gotta do it fast, and get out the door before you're late.
    - Sometimes you can't afford to write a good commit and spend 30 minutes figureing out how to exit vim.

For those times, there's this.

## Credits

All code was either basic, or stolen from stack overflow.
Feel free to steal it to.

## Testing

The testing protocal is to use the script and check the result on github.
